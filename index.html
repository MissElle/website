          <p class="education">Personal:</p>
            <p>Elle Pope is small home Wisconsin living in big city Seattle. They are a creator who strives for the functional, the bizarre, and the new. They enjoy discussion, discovery, and cake.</p>
            <p>Elle's Ultimate goal is to create alternate forms of communication in media in order to encourage and harbor positivity and critical thinking in today's youth. Internet, video games, and writing are safe havens for many people. For example, their current project is a point-in-click hybrid adventure/mystery game based upon the events of the Tusegee studies of Alabama circa 1960s. In this game, one plays as fictional character Claire Newman, collecting clues that lead them to uncover the atrocities that happened in America's past. By combining hitory with fiction, Elle hopes to harbor critical thinking about the world's current state of affairs.</p>
            <p>Beyond their work, Elle enjoys reading about advances in mathematics, science, psychology, and anthropology. They also enjoy running, playing with their pet rats, and engaging with people. Currently, they are an administrator of SeaSAW (Seattle Society of Artists and Writers) where members work on new forms of creativity to keep their minds sharp.</p>
